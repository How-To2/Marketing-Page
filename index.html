        <p>Our website allows users to create a profile and log in to their account.  Users can create blog style posts that they can share, edit and remove.  There is also a search function and ‘like button’ included.  The posts with the most likes are displayed first.  In the future we wish to have fully functioning How-To videos, a forum, instant messaging and a bookmark feature.  This site takes inspiration from other business models such as Reddit, WikiHow and Google.</p>

        <p>How-To uses Framework Libraries such as React, Redux, Less, Helmet, CORS, JsonWebtoken, and Express.  We do not require an API or Apple Frameworks.  We hope you enjoy the site as we put much effort into this creation.  If you have any suggestions feel free to visit our ‘Contact Us’ page and send an email.  We take our customers seriously!</p>
