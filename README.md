# Marketing-Page

This Marketing Page for our How-To Webiste consists of three live pages.  We have a Landing Page that was created by Cole Wilkison
and Tharshan Ketheeswaran.  It involves a custom header with a unique company logo we created.  We also display:flexed the header
to create a nice and easy to read layout.  The landing page consists of 3 containers that hold images and text information
about our project.  It has been properly scaled to fit a 500px device.

The About Us page was also created by Cole and Tharshan.  Together we properly flex boxed the profiles of each of our teammates in
the project.  We also used custom photos and edited them to have a visually pleasing circle-border.  This page also contains
the custom header/footer combo used in all three pages.  This page is properly scaled to fit a 500px device.

The Contact Us page was created solely by Cole.  It contains a form with Name, Email and Subject inputs.  It also contains a 
text area that will recieve the customers message.  Cole also used unique CSS styling to include a background-image that 
fills blank space for the email form as well as includes linkable social media icons at the bottom of the page.  This page
is properly scaled to fit a 500px device.
